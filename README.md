The aim of this project was to create a card-based tool that recommend baking recipes to users who are in lack of inspiration. This tool is a demand from a fictitious company named Nesti.  

The project was divided into three parts:  
- Create a web page with cards (HTML/CSS/Tailwind),  
- Animate the cards when the user clicks on buttons (JavaScript),  
- Save the card that the user has chosen and display the recipes in accordance with his answers (JavaScript/JSON).

Requirements:  
- The name of the variables and the comments have to be in English,
- Creation and use of a Card class for each ingredient card,
- The recipes have to be stored in a JSON file,
- The number of ingredients must be large enough to have convincing results (minimum 20 recipes),
- Use of royalty-free images,
- Add a card overlay effect.
